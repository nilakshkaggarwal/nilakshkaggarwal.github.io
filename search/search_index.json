It happens only for Mercury and Venus Occulation Moon/Planets Eclipsing distant object is known as occulation Retrograde Motion Planet appears moving in opposite direction Other Terms Inferior Planet - Has an orbit that is closer than the Earth-Sun distance. (Mercury and Venus) Superior Planet - Has an orbit that is farther than the Earth-Sun distance. (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) Opposition - A planetary position in which the Sun, the Earth and a superior planet are aligned in that order and in a straight line. This is also the best time to observe a planet because: \u2022 it is at its closest approach to Earth. \u2022 the planet rises just as the Sun is setting, allowing observation any time during the night. Quadrature - A planetary position in which the Sun, the Earth and a superior planet form a right angle with the Earth at the vertex. At sunset during eastern quadrature, a superior planet is overhead and is overhead at sunrise during western quadrature. Conjunction - A planetary position in which the Earth, the Sun and the planet are aligned in that order and in a straight line. For an inferior planet this is called a superior conjunction. When the order is the Earth, the inferior planet and the Sun, it is an inferior conjunction. A conjunction is the worst time to observe a planet because it is lost in the Sun's brilliance. Greatest Elongation - Point at which an inferior planet has the greatest visual distance from the Sun. (Mercury 28\u00ba Venus 47\u00ba) During Greatest Eastern Elongation an inferior planet is visible at sunset and is visible before sunrise during Greatest Western Elongation. Retrograde Motion Retrograde motion is the apparent motion of a planet in a direction opposite to that of other bodies within its system, as observed from a particular vantage point.

The 88 constellations depict 42 animals, 29 inanimate objects and 17 humans or mythological characters. The constellations are grouped in 8 families. Initially grouped by Menzel mainly because of their position on celestial sphere. Ursa Major Family : - The Ursa Major Family includes 10 northern constellations in the vicinity of Ursa Major: Ursa Major itself, Ursa Minor, Draco, Canes Venatici, Bo\u00f6tes, Coma Berenices, Corona Borealis, Camelopardalis, Lynx, and Leo Minor. The eponymous constellation Ursa Major contains the famous Big Dipper. Zodiac : - The Zodiac is a group of 12 constellations: Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, Gemini, and Cancer. Some version of these constellations are found in traditions around the world. This band around the celestial sphere includes the ecliptic, the apparent path of the sun through the year. These constellations therefore are all associated with zodiac signs. Perseus Family : - The Perseus Family includes 9 constellations associated with the Perseus myth: Cassiopeia, Cepheus, Andromeda, Perseus, Pegasus, and Cetus (representing the monster sent to devour Andromeda). Few neighboring constellations: Auriga, Lacerta, and Triangulum are also included in this family. This group reaches from near the north celestial pole to declination \u221230\u00b0. Hercules Family : - The Hercules Family is a group of 19 constellations connected mainly by their adjacency on the celestial sphere. It is largest grouping, and extends from declination +60\u00b0 to \u221270\u00b0, mostly in the western hemisphere. It includes Hercules, Sagitta, Aquila, Lyra, Cygnus, Vulpecula, Hydra, Sextans, Crater, Corvus, Ophiuchus, Serpens, Scutum, Centaurus, Lupus, Corona Australis, Ara, Triangulum Australe, and Crux. Orion Family : - The Orion Family, on the opposite side of the sky from the Hercules Family contains 5 constellations, which includes Orion, Canis Major, Canis Minor, Lepus, and Monoceros. This group of constellations draws from Greek myth, representing the hunter (Orion) and his two dogs (Canis Major and Canis Minor) chasing the hare (Lepus). Menzel added the unicorn (Monoceros) for completeness. Heavenly Waters : - The Heavenly Waters draws from the Mesopotamian tradition associating the dim area between Sagittarius and Orion with the god Ea and the Waters of the Abyss have 9 constellations. Aquarius and Capricornus, derived from Mesopotamian constellations, would have been natural members had they not already been assigned to the Zodiac group. Instead, Menzel expanded the area and included several disparate constellations, most associated with water in some form: Delphinus, Equuleus, Eridanus, Piscis Austrinus, Carina, Puppis, Vela, Pyxis, and Columba. Carina, Puppis, and Vela historically formed part of the former constellation Argo Navis, which in Greek tradition represented the ship of Jason. Bayer Family : - The Bayer Family collects several southern constellations first introduced by Petrus Plancius. The group includes 11 constellations. Hydrus, Dorado, Volans, Apus, Pavo, Grus, Phoenix, Tucana, Indus, Chamaeleon, and Musca. Bayer labeled Musca as \"Apis\" (the Bee), but over time it was renamed. (Bayer's twelfth new southern constellation, Triangulum Australe, was placed by Menzel in the Hercules Family.) The Bayer Family circles the south celestial pole, forming an irregular contiguous band. Because these constellations are located in the far southern sky, their stars were not visible to the ancient Greeks and Romans. La Caille Family : - The La Caille Family comprises 12 of the 13 constellations introduced by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille represent scientific instruments, together with Mensa making it 13 constellation family. The group includes Norma, Circinus, Telescopium, Microscopium, Sculptor, Fornax, Caelum, Horologium, Octans, Mensa, Reticulum, Pictor, and Antlia. These dim constellations are scattered throughout the far southern sky, and their stars were mostly not visible to the ancient Greeks and Romans. (Menzel assigned Pyxis, the remaining Lacaille instrument, to the Heavenly Waters group.) Andromeda Antilla Apus Aquarius Aquilla Ara Aries Auriga Bootes Caelum Camelopardalis Cancer Canes Venatici Canis Major Canis Minor Capricorn Carina Cassiopeia Centaurus Cepheus Cetus Chameleon Circinus Columba Coma Berenices Corona Australis Corona Borealis Corvus Crater Crux Cygnus Delphinus Dorado Draco Equuleus Eridanus Fornax Gemini Grus Hercules Horologium Hydra Hydrus Indus Lacerta Leo Leo Minor Lepus Libra Lupus Lynx Lyra Mensa Microscopium Monoceros Musca Norma Octans Ophiuchus Orion Pavo Pegasus Perseus Phoenix Pictor Pisces Piscis Austrinus Puppis Pyxis Reticulum Sagitta Sagittarius Scorpius Sculptor Scutum Serpens 76.1 Serpens (Caput) 76.2 Serpens(Cauda) Sextans Taurus Telescopium Triangulum Triangulum Australe Tucana Ursa Major Ursa Minor Vela Virgo Volans Vulpecula 1. Andromeda Abbreviation And Family Perseus Origin Ancient Meaning Andromeda (a chained lady) Nakshatra Uttara Bhadrapada* (Alpheratz) Messiers M31, M32, M110 Brightest Star Alpheratz (mag: 2.06) Bordering Constellations Perseus, Cassiopeia, Lacerta, Pegasus, Pisces, Triangulum Located north of the celestial equator, it is named for Andromeda, daughter of Cassiopeia, in the Greek myth, who was chained to a rock to be eaten by the sea monster Cetus. Andromeda is most prominent during autumn evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, along with several other constellations named for characters in the Perseus myth. Because of its northern declination, Andromeda is visible only north of 40\u00b0 south latitude; for observers farther south it lies below the horizon. It is one of the largest constellations, with an area of 722 square degrees. Its brightest star, Alpha Andromedae, is a binary star that has also been counted as a part of Pegasus, while Gamma Andromedae is a colourful binary and a popular target for amateur astronomers. Only marginally dimmer than Alpha, Beta Andromedae is a red giant, its colour visible to the naked eye. The constellation's most obvious deep-sky object is the naked-eye Andromeda Galaxy (M31, also called the Great Galaxy of Andromeda), the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way and one of the brightest Messier objects. Several fainter galaxies, including M31's companions M110 and M32, as well as the more distant NGC 891, lie within Andromeda. The Blue Snowball Nebula, a planetary nebula, is visible in a telescope as a blue circular object. 2. Antlia Abbreviation Ant Family La Caille Origin 1763, Lacaille Meaning Airpump Messiers - Brightest Star \u03b1-Antillae (mag: 4.25) Bordering Constellations Hydra, Pyxis, Vela, Centaurus Antlia is a constellation in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere. Its name means \"pump\" in Latin; it represents an air pump. Originally Antlia Pneumatica, the constellation was established by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in the 18th century, though its name was later abbreviated by John Herschel. Located close to the stars forming the old constellation of the ship Argo Navis, Antlia is completely visible from latitudes south of 49 degrees north. Antlia is a faint constellation; its brightest star is Alpha Antliae, an orange giant that is a suspected variable star, ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. S Antliae is an eclipsing binary star system, changing in brightness as one star passes in front of the other. Sharing a common envelope, the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star. Two star systems with known exoplanets, HD 93083 and WASP-66, lie within Antlia, as do NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy, and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy. 3. Apus Abbreviation Aps Family Bayer Origin 1603, Uranometria, created by Keyser and de Houtman Meaning Bird-of-paradise or Exotic Bird or Extraordinary Bird Messiers - Brightest Star \u03b1-Apodis (mag: 3.83) Bordering Constellations Triangulum Australe, Circinus, Musca, Chamaeleon, Octans, Pavo, Ara Apus is a small constellation in the southern sky, first defined in the late 16th century. Its name means \"no feet\" in Greek, and it represents a bird-of-paradise, which was once wrongly believed to lack feet. Its genitive is \"Apodis\". The orange giant Alpha Apodis is the brightest star in the constellation. Two star systems have been found to have planets. Apus was one of twelve constellations created by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman who had sailed on the first Dutch trading expedition, known as the Eerste Schipvaart, to the East Indies. The name Apus is derived from the Greek apous, meaning \"without feet\". This referred to the Western misconception that the bird-of-paradise had no feet. Richard Allen reports Semler's assertion that de Houtman, who observed the southern constellations from the island of Sumatra, took his ideas for the formation of Apus (as well as Phoenix and Indus) from the Chinese, who knew the stars of Apus as the \"Little Wonder Bird\", and that Semler's assertion was disputed by Ideler (though Ideler acknowledged the Chinese constellations). 4. Aquarius Abbreviation Aqr Family Zodiac Origin Ancient Meaning Water-Bearer Nakshatra Shatabhisha (\u03b3-Aquarii) Messiers M2, M72, M73 Brightest Star \u03b2-Aquarii \u2013 Sadalsuud (mag: 2.91) Bordering Constellations Pisces, Pegasus, Equuleus, Delphinus, Aquila, Capricornus, Piscis Austrinus, Sculptor, Cetus Aquarius is a constellation of the zodiac, situated between Capricornus and Pisces. Its name is Latin for \"water-carrier\" or \"cup-carrier\", and its symbol is Aquarius.svg (Unicode \u2652), a representation of water. Aquarius is one of the oldest of the recognized constellations along the zodiac (the sun's apparent path). It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century AD astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is found in a region often called the Sea due to its profusion of constellations with watery associations such as Cetus the whale, Pisces the fish, and Eridanus the river. Because of its position away from the galactic plane, the majority of deep-sky objects in Aquarius are galaxies, globular clusters, and planetary nebulae. Aquarius contains three deep sky objects that are in the Messier catalog: the globular clusters Messier 2, Messier 72, and the open cluster Messier 73. Two well-known planetary nebulae are also located in Aquarius: the Saturn Nebula (NGC 7009), to the southeast of \u03bc Aquarii; and the famous Helix Nebula (NGC 7293), southwest of \u03b4 Aquarii. 5. Aquila Abbreviation Aql Family Hercules Origin 1603, Uranometria, created by Keyser and de Houtman Meaning Eagle Nakshatra Shravana (\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 Aquilae) Messiers - Brightest Star Altair (mag: 0.76) Bordering Constellations Sagitta, Hercules, Ophiuchus, Serpens Cauda, Scutum, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Delphinus Aquila is a constellation in the northern sky. Its name is Latin for 'eagle' and it represents the bird who carried Zeus/Jupiter's thunderbolts in Greco-Roman mythology. Aquila lies astride the celestial equator. The alpha star, Altair, is a vertex of the Summer Triangle asterism. The constellation is best seen in the summer as it is located along the Milky Way. Because of this location along the line of our galaxy, many clusters and nebulae are found within its borders, but they are dim and there are few galaxies. Ptolemy catalogued nineteen stars jointly in this constellation and in the now obsolete constellation of Antinous, which was named in the reign of the emperor Hadrian (AD 117\u2013138), but sometimes erroneously attributed to Tycho Brahe, who catalogued twelve stars in Aquila and seven in Antinous. Hevelius determined twenty-three stars in the first and nineteen in the second. The Greek Aquila is probably based on the Babylonian constellation of the Eagle. 6. Ara Abbreviation Ara Family Hercules Origin Ancient Meaning Altar Messiers - Brightest Star \u03b2-Arae (mag: 2.84) Bordering Constellations Corona Australis, Scorpius, Norma, Triangulum Australe, Apus, Pavo, Telescopium Ara is a southern constellation situated between Scorpius and Triangulum Australe. Its Latin name means \"altar\". Ara was one of the 48 Greek constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. In ancient Greek mythology, Ara was identified as the altar where the gods first made offerings and formed an alliance before defeating the Titans. The nearby Milky Way represents the smoke rising from the offerings on the altar. 7. Aries Abbreviation Ari Family Zodiac Origin Ancient Meaning Ram Nakshatra Ashwini (\u03b2 and \u03b3 Arietis), Bharani (35, 39, and 41 Arietis) Messiers - Brightest Star Hamal (mag: 2.01) Bordering Constellations Perseus, Triangulum, Pisces, Cetus, Taurus Aries is one of the constellations of the zodiac. It is located in the northern celestial hemisphere between Pisces to the west and Taurus to the east. The name Aries is Latin for ram, and its symbol is Aries.svg (Unicode \u2648), representing a ram's horns. It is one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It is a mid-sized constellation, ranking 39th overall size, with an area of 441 square degrees (1.1% of the celestial sphere). Although Aries came to represent specifically the ram whose fleece became the Golden Fleece of Ancient Greek mythology, it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. Before that, the stars of Aries formed a farmhand. Different cultures have incorporated the stars of Aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in China and a porpoise in the Marshall Islands. Aries is a relatively dim constellation, possessing only four bright stars: Hamal (Alpha Arietis, second magnitude), Sheratan (Beta Arietis, third magnitude), Mesarthim (Gamma Arietis, fourth magnitude), and 41 Arietis (also fourth magnitude). The few deep-sky objects within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies. Several meteor showers appear to radiate from Aries, including the Daytime Arietids and the Epsilon Arietids. 8. Auriga Abbreviation Aur Family Perseus Origin Ancient Meaning charioteer Messiers M36, M37, M38 Brightest Star Capella (mag: 0.08) Bordering Constellations Camelopardalis, Perseus, Taurus, Gemini, Lynx Auriga is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Located north of the celestial equator, its name is the Latin word for \"charioteer\", associating it with various mythological charioteers, including Erichthonius and Myrtilus. Auriga is most prominent during winter evenings in the Northern Hemisphere, along with the five other constellations that have stars in the Winter Hexagon asterism. Because of its northern declination, Auriga is only visible in its entirety as far as 34\u00b0 south; for observers farther south it lies partially or fully below the horizon. A large constellation, with an area of 657 square degrees, it is half the size of the largest constellation, Hydra. Its brightest star, Capella, is an unusual multiple star system among the brightest stars in the night sky. Beta Aurigae is an interesting variable star in the constellation; Epsilon Aurigae, a nearby eclipsing binary with an unusually long period, has been studied intensively. Because of its position near the winter Milky Way, Auriga has many bright open clusters in its borders, including M36, M37, and M38, popular targets for amateur astronomers. In addition, it has one prominent nebula, the Flaming Star Nebula, associated with the variable star AE Aurigae. 9. Bootes Abbreviation Boo Family Ursa Major Origin Ancient Meaning Herdsman Nakshatra Swati (Arcturus) Messiers - Brightest Star Arcturus (mag: -0.04) Bordering Constellations Canes Venatici, Coma Berenices, Corona Borealis, Draco, Hercules, Serpens Caput, Virgo, Ursa Major Bo\u00f6tes is a constellation in the northern sky, located between 0\u00b0 and +60\u00b0 declination, and 13 and 16 hours of right ascension on the celestial sphere. The name comes from the Greek \u0392\u03bf\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, Bo\u014dt\u0113s, meaning herdsman or ploughman (literally, ox-driver; from \u03b2\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 bous \u201ccow\u201d). The \"\u00f6\" in the name is a diaeresis, not an umlaut, meaning that each 'o' is to be pronounced separately. One of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, Bo\u00f6tes is now one of the 88 modern constellations. It contains the fourth brightest star in the night sky, the orange-hued Arcturus. Bo\u00f6tes is home to many other bright stars, including eight above the fourth magnitude and an additional 21 above the fifth magnitude, making a total of 29 stars easily visible to the naked eye. In ancient Babylon the stars of Bo\u00f6tes were known as SHU.PA. They were apparently depicted as the god Enlil, who was the leader of the Babylonian pantheon and special patron of farmers. The name Bo\u00f6tes was first used by Homer in his Odyssey as a celestial reference point for navigation, described as \"late-setting\" or \"slow to set\", translated as the \"Ploughman\". 10. Caelum Abbreviation Cae Family La Caille Origin 1763, Lacaille Meaning Chisel Messiers - Brightest Star \u03b1-Caile (mag: 4.45) Bordering Constellations Columba, Lepus, Eridanus, Horologium, Dorado, Pictor Caelum is a faint constellation in the southern sky, introduced in the 1750s by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille and counted among the 88 modern constellations. Its name means \u201cchisel\u201d in Latin, and it was formerly known as Caelum Scalptorium (\u201cthe engravers\u2019 chisel\u201d); It is a rare word, unrelated to the far more common Latin caelum, meaning \u201csky, heaven, atmosphere\u201d.[3] It is the eighth-smallest constellation, and subtends a solid angle of around 0.038 steradians, just less than that of Corona Australis. Due to its small size and location away from the plane of the Milky Way, Caelum is a rather barren constellation, with few objects of interest. The constellation's brightest star, Alpha Caeli, is only of magnitude 4.45, and only one other star, (Gamma)\u03b3 Caeli, is brighter than magnitude 5 . Other notable objects in Caelum are RR Caeli, a binary star with one known planet approximately 20.13 parsecs (65.7 ly) away; X Caeli, a Delta Scuti variable that forms an optical double with \u03b3 1 Caeli; and HE0450-2958, a Seyfert galaxy that at first appeared as just a jet, with no host galaxy visible. 11. Camelopardalis Abbreviation Cam Family Ursa Major Origin 1613, Plancius Meaning Giraffe Messiers - Brightest Star \u03b2-Camelopardalis (mag: 4.03) Bordering Constellations Draco, Ursa Minor, Cepheus, Cassiopeia, Perseus, Auriga, Lynx, Ursa Major Camelopardalis or the Giraffe constellation is a large, faint grouping of stars in the northern sky. The constellation was introduced in 1612 (or 1613) by Petrus Plancius. Some older astronomy books give an alternative spelling of the name, Camelopardus. First attested in English in 1785, the word camelopardalis comes from Latin,[3] and it is the romanisation of the Greek \"\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2\" meaning \"giraffe\", from \"\u03ba\u03ac\u03bc\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\" (kam\u0113los), \"camel\" + \"\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2\" (pardalis), \"leopard\", due to its having a long neck like a camel and spots like a leopard. 12. Cancer Abbreviation Cnc Family Zodiac Origin Ancient Meaning Crab Nakshatra Pushya (\u03b3, \u03b4 and \u03b8 Cancri) Messiers M44, M67 Brightest Star Altarf (\u03b2-Cancri) (mag: 3.53) Bordering Constellations Lynx, Gemini, Canis Minor, Hydra, Leo, Leo Minor Cancer is one of the twelve constellations of the zodiac. Its name is Latin for crab and it is commonly represented as one. Its astrological symbol is Cancer.svg (Unicode \u264b). Cancer is a medium-size constellation with an area of 506 square degrees and its stars are rather faint, its brightest star Beta Cancri having an apparent magnitude of 3.5. It contains two stars with known planets, including 55 Cancri, which has five: one super-earth and four gas giants, one of which is in the habitable zone and as such has expected temperatures similar to Earth. Located at the centre of the constellation is Praesepe (Messier 44), one of the closest open clusters to Earth and a popular target for amateur astronomers. 13. Canes Venatici Abbreviation CVn Family Ursa Major Origin 1690, Firmamentum Sobiescianum, Hevelius Meaning Hunting dogs Messiers M3, M51, M63, M94, M106 Brightest Star Cor Coroli (mag: 2.90) Bordering Constellations Ursa Major, Bo\u00f6tes , Coma Berenices Canes Venatici is one of the 88 official modern constellations. It is a small northern constellation that was created by Johannes Hevelius in the 17th century. Its name is Latin for \"hunting dogs\", and the constellation is often depicted in illustrations as representing the dogs of Bo\u00f6tes the Herdsman, a neighboring constellation. The stars of Canes Venatici are not bright. In classical times, they were included by Ptolemy within the constellation Ursa Major in his star catalogue. \u03b1 CVn was Ptolemy's \"28th of Ursa Major\", and \u03b2 CVn was his \"29th of Ursa Major\" 14. Canis Major Abbreviation CMa Family Orion Origin Ancient Meaning Greater dog Messiers M41 Brightest Star Sirius (mag: -1.46) Bordering Constellations Monoceros, Lepus, Columba, Puppis Canis Major is a constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere. In the second century, it was included in Ptolemy's 48 constellations, and is counted among the 88 modern constellations. Its name is Latin for \"greater dog\" in contrast to Canis Minor, the \"lesser dog\"; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of Orion the hunter through the sky. The Milky Way passes through Canis Major and several open clusters lie within its borders, most notably M41. Canis Major contains Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, known as the \"dog star\". It is bright because of its proximity to the Solar System. In contrast, the other bright stars of the constellation are stars of great distance and high luminosity. At magnitude 1.5, Epsilon Canis Majoris (Adhara) is the second brightest star of the constellation and the brightest source of extreme ultraviolet radiation in the night sky. Next in brightness are the yellow-white supergiant Delta (Wezen) at 1.8, the blue-white giant Beta (Mirzam) at 2.0, blue-white supergiants Eta (Aludra) at 2.4 and Omicron1 at 3.0, and white spectroscopic binary Zeta (Furud), also at 3.0. The red hypergiant VY Canis Majoris is one of the largest stars known, while the neutron star RX J0720.4-3125 has a radius of a mere 5 km. 15. Canis Minor Abbreviation CMi Family Orion Origin Ancient Meaning Lesser Dog Messiers - Brightest Star Procyon (mag: 0.34) Bordering Constellations Monoceros, Gemini, Cancer, Hydra Canis Minor is a small constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. In the second century, it was included as an asterism, or pattern, of two stars in Ptolemy's 48 constellations, and it is counted among the 88 modern constellations. Its name is Latin for \"lesser dog\", in contrast to Canis Major, the \"greater dog\"; both figures are commonly represented as following the constellation of Orion the hunter. Canis Minor contains only two stars brighter than the fourth magnitude, Procyon (Alpha Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 0.34, and Gomeisa (Beta Canis Minoris), with a magnitude of 2.9. The constellation's dimmer stars were noted by Johann Bayer, who named eight stars including Alpha and Beta, and John Flamsteed, who numbered fourteen. Procyon is the seventh-brightest star in the night sky, as well as one of the closest. A yellow-white main sequence star, it has a white dwarf companion. Gomeisa is a blue-white main sequence star. Luyten's Star is a ninth-magnitude red dwarf and the Solar System's next closest stellar neighbour in the constellation after Procyon. The fourth-magnitude HD 66141, which has evolved into an orange giant towards the end of its life cycle, was discovered to have a planet in 2012. There are two faint deep sky objects within the constellation's borders. The 11 Canis-Minorids are a meteor shower that can be seen in early December. 16. Capricorn Abbreviation Cap Family Zodiac Origin Ancient Meaning Sea got Messiers M30 Brightest Star Deneb Algedi (mag: 2.85) Bordering Constellations Aquila, Sagittarius, Microscopium, Piscis Austrinus Capricornus is one of the constellations of the zodiac. Its name is Latin for \"horned goat\" or \"goat horn\", and it is commonly represented in the form of a sea-goat: a mythical creature that is half goat, half fish. Its symbol is Capricorn symbol 2.png (Unicode \u2651). Capricornus is one of the 88 modern constellations, and was also one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy. Under its modern boundaries it is bordered by Aquila, Sagittarius, Microscopium, Piscis Austrinus, and Aquarius. The constellation is located in an area of sky called the Sea or the Water, consisting of many water-related constellations such as Aquarius, Pisces and Eridanus. It is the smallest constellation in the zodiac. 17. Carina Abbreviation Car Family Heavenly Waters Origin 1763, Lacaille, split from Argo Navis Meaning keel Messiers - Brightest Star Canopus (mag: -0.076) Bordering Constellations Vela, Puppis, Pictor, Volans, Chamaeleon, Musca, Centaurus Carina is a constellation in the southern sky. Its name is Latin for the keel of a ship, and it was formerly part of the larger constellation of Argo Navis (the ship Argo) until that constellation was divided into three pieces, the other two being Puppis (the poop deck), and Vela (the sails of the ship). Carina contains Canopus, a white-hued supergiant that is the second brightest star in the night sky at magnitude \u22120.72, 313 light-years from Earth. Alpha Carinae, as Canopus is formally designated, is a variable star that varies by approximately 0.1 magnitudes. Its traditional name comes from the mythological Canopus, who was a navigator for Menelaus, king of Sparta 18. Cassiopeia Abbreviation Cas Family Perseus Origin Ancient Meaning Cassiopeia (mythological character) Messiers M52, M103 Brightest Star Shedir (mag: 2.15) Bordering Constellations Camelopardalis, Cepheus, Lacerta, Andromeda, Perseus Cassiopeia is a constellation in the northern sky, named after the vain queen Cassiopeia in Greek mythology, who boasted about her unrivalled beauty. Cassiopeia was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century Greek astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. It is easily recognizable due to its distinctive 'M' shape when in upper culmination but in higher northern locations when near lower culminations in spring and summer it has a 'W' shape, formed by five bright stars. It is bordered by Andromeda to the south, Perseus to the southeast, and Cepheus to the north. It is opposite the Big Dipper. In northern locations above 34\u00baN latitude it is visible year-round and in the (sub)tropics it can be seen at its clearest from September to early November in its characteristic 'M' shape. Even in low southern latitudes below 25\u00baS it can be seen low in the North. 19. Centaurus Abbreviation Cen Family Hercules Origin Ancient Meaning Centaur Messiers - Brightest Star Alpha Centauri (mag: -0.27) Bordering Constellations Antlia, Carina, Circinus, Crux, Hydra, Libra, Lupus, Musca, Vela Centaurus is a bright constellation in the southern sky. One of the largest constellations, Centaurus was included among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. In Greek mythology, Centaurus represents a centaur; a creature that is half human, half horse (another constellation named after a centaur is one from the zodiac: Sagittarius). Notable stars include Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to the Solar System, its neighbour in the sky Beta Centauri, and V766 Centauri, one of the largest stars yet discovered. The constellation also contains Omega Centauri, the brightest globular cluster as visible from Earth and one of the largest known. 20. Cepheus Abbreviation Cep Family Perseus Origin Ancient Meaning Cepheus Messiers - Brightest Star Alderamin (mag: 2.45) Bordering Constellations Cygnus, Lacerta, Cassiopeia, Camelopardalis, Draco, Ursa Minor Cepheus is a constellation in the northern sky. It is named after Cepheus, King of Aethiopia in Greek mythology. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Its brightest star is Alpha Cephei with an apparent magnitude of 3.5. Delta Cephei is the prototype of an important class of star known as a Cepheid variable. RW Cephei, an orange hypergiant, together with the red supergiants Mu Cephei, VV Cephei and V354 Cephei are among the largest stars known. In addition, Cepheus also has the hyperluminous quasar S5 0014+81, hosting an ultramassive black hole in its core at 40 billion solar masses, about 10,000 times more massive than the central black hole of the Milky Way, making it the most massive black hole known in the universe. 21. Cetus Abbreviation Cet Family Perseus Origin Ancient Meaning sea monster (later interpreted as a whale) Messiers M77 Brightest Star Deneb Kaitos (mag: 2.04) Bordering Constellations Aries, Pisces, Aquarius, Sculptor, Fornax, Eridanus, Taurus Cetus is a constellation. Its name refers to Cetus, a sea monster in Greek mythology, although it is often called 'the whale' today. Cetus is located in the region of the sky that contains other water-related constellations such as Aquarius, Pisces, and Eridanus. Although Cetus is not generally considered part of the zodiac, the ecliptic passes less than a quarter of a degree from its constellation boundary, and thus the moon, planets, and even part of the sun may be in Cetus for brief periods of time. 22. Chameleon Abbreviation Cha Family Bayer Origin 1603, Uranometria, created by Keyser and de Houtman Meaning Chameleon Messiers - Brightest Star \u03b1-Chameleonitis (mag: 4.05) Bordering Constellations Musca, Carina, Volans, Mensa, Octans, Apus Chamaeleon is a small constellation in the southern sky. It is named after the chameleon, a kind of lizard. It was first defined in the 16th century. Chamaeleon was one of twelve constellations created by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. It first appeared on a 35-cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 (or 1598) in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius. Johann Bayer was the first uranographer to put Chamaeleon in a celestial atlas. It was one of many constellations created by European explorers in the 15th and 16th centuries out of unfamiliar Southern Hemisphere stars. 23. Circinus Abbreviation Cir Famil y La Caille Origin 1763, Lacaille Meaning Compass Messiers - Brightest Star \u03b1-Circini (mag: 3.19) Bordering Constellations Centaurus, Musca, Apus, Triangulum Australe, Norma, Lupus Circinus is a small, faint constellation in the southern sky, first defined in 1756 by the French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille. Its name is Latin for compass, referring to the drafting tool used for drawing circles (it should not be confused with Pyxis, a constellation that represents a mariner's compass which points north). Its brightest star is Alpha Circini, with an apparent magnitude of 3.19. Slightly variable, it is the brightest rapidly oscillating Ap star in the night sky. AX Circini is a Cepheid variable visible with the unaided eye, and BX Circini is a faint star thought to have been formed from the merger of two white dwarfs. Two sun-like stars have planetary systems: HD 134060 has two small planets, and HD 129445 has a Jupiter-like planet. Supernova SN 185 appeared in Circinus in 185 AD and was recorded by Chinese observers. Two novae have been observed more recently, in the 20th century. The Milky Way runs through the constellation, featuring prominent objects such as the open cluster NGC 5823 and the planetary nebula NGC 5315. Circinus hosts one notable spiral galaxy, the Circinus Galaxy, which was discovered in 1977 and is the closest Seyfert galaxy to the Milky Way. The Alpha Circinids (ACI), a meteor shower also discovered in 1977, radiate from this constellation. 24. Columba Abbreviation Col Family Heavenly Waters Origin 1592, Plancius, split from Canis Major Meaning Dove Messiers - Brightest Star Phact (mag: 2.65) Bordering Constellations Lepus, Caelum, Pictor, Puppis, Canis Major Columba is a small, faint constellation created in the late sixteenth century. Its name is Latin for dove. It is located just south of Canis Major and Lepus. Columba was created by Dutch astronomer Petrus Plancius in 1592 in order to differentiate the 'unformed stars' of the large constellation Canis Major. Plancius first depicted Columba on the small celestial planispheres of his large wall map of 1592. It is also shown on his smaller world map of 1594 and on early Dutch celestial globes. 25. Coma Berenices Abbreviation Com Family Ursa Major Origin 1603, Uranometria, split from Leo Meaning Berenice\u2019s hair Messiers M53, M64, M85, M88, M91, M98, M99, M100 Brightest Star \u03b2-Comae Berenices (mag: 4.26) Bordering Constellations Canes Venatici, Ursa Major, Leo, Virgo, Bo\u00f6tes Coma Berenices is a traditional asterism that has since been defined as one of the 88 modern constellations. It is located near Arcturus, and the constellation Leo to which it formerly belonged, and contains the North Galactic Pole. Its name means \"Berenice's Hair\" (in Greek, via Latin), and refers to the legend of Queen Berenice II of Egypt, who sacrificed her long hair. Although Coma Berenices is not a large constellation, it contains eight Messier objects. The constellation is rich in galaxies, containing the northern part of the Virgo cluster. There are also several globular clusters to be seen. These objects can be seen with minimal obscuration from dust because the constellation is not in the direction of the galactic plane (the North Pole of the galactic plane is in this constellation). However, because of this fact, there are few open clusters (except for the Coma Berenices Cluster, which dominates the northern part of the constellation), diffuse nebulae, or planetary nebulae. 26. Corona Australis Abbreviation CrA Family Hercules Origin Ancient Meaning Southern Crown Messiers - Brightest Star Alphekka Meridiana (mag: 4.10) Bordering Constellations Sagittarius, Scorpius, Ara, Telescopium Corona Australis or Corona Austrina is a constellation in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere. Its Latin name means \"southern crown\", and it is the southern counterpart of Corona Borealis, the Northern Crown. One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. The Ancient Greeks saw Corona Australis as a wreath rather than a crown and associated it with Sagittarius or Centaurus. Other cultures have likened the pattern to a turtle, ostrich nest, a tent, or even a hut belonging to a rock hyrax.Although fainter than its namesake, the oval- or horseshoe-shaped pattern of its brighter stars renders it distinctive. Alpha and Beta Coronae Australis are the two brightest stars with an apparent magnitude of around 4.1. Epsilon Coronae Australis is the brightest example of a W Ursae Majoris variable in the southern sky. Lying alongside the Milky Way, Corona Australis contains one of the closest star-forming regions to the Solar System\u2014a dusty dark nebula known as the Corona Australis Molecular Cloud, lying about 430 light years away. Within it are stars at the earliest stages of their lifespan. The variable stars R and TY Coronae Australis light up parts of the nebula, which varies in brightness accordingly. 27. Corona Borealis Abbreviation CrB Family Ursa Major Origin Ancient Meaning Northern Crown Messiers - Brightest Star Alphecca (mag: 2.21) Bordering Constellations Hercules, Bo\u00f6tes, Serpens Caput Corona Borealis is a small constellation in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere. It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Its brightest stars form a semicircular arc. Its Latin name, inspired by its shape, means \"northern crown\". In classical mythology Corona Borealis generally represented the crown given by the god Dionysus to the Cretan princess Ariadne and set by him in the heavens. Other cultures likened the pattern to a circle of elders, an eagle's nest, a bear's den, or even a smokehole. Ptolemy also listed a southern counterpart, Corona Australis, with a similar pattern. The brightest star is the magnitude 2.2 Alpha Coronae Borealis. The yellow supergiant R Coronae Borealis is the prototype of a rare class of giant stars\u2014the R Coronae Borealis variables\u2014that are extremely hydrogen deficient, and thought to result from the merger of two white dwarfs. T Coronae Borealis, also known as the Blaze Star, is another unusual type of variable star known as a recurrent nova. Normally of magnitude 10, it last flared up to magnitude 2 in 1946. ADS 9731 and Sigma Coronae Borealis are multiple star systems with six and five components respectively. Five star systems have been found to have Jupiter-sized exoplanets. Abell 2065 is a highly concentrated galaxy cluster one billion light-years from the Solar System containing more than 400 members, and is itself part of the larger Corona Borealis Supercluster. 28.

Its name means \"raven\" in Latin. One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, it depicts a raven that has been associated with the god Apollo and is perched on the back of Hydra the water snake. The four brightest stars, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, and Beta Corvi form a distinctive quadrilateral in the night sky. Known as Gienah, the ageing blue giant Gamma Corvi is the brightest star in the constellation. The young star Eta Corvi has been found to have two debris disks. Two star systems have exoplanets, and a third planetary system is unconfirmed. 29. Crater Abbreviation Crt Family Hercules Origin Ancient Meaning Cup Messiers - Brightest Star Labrum (mag: 3.57) Bordering Constellations Leo, Sextans, Hydra, Corvus, Virgo Crater is a constellation. Its name is Latin for cup, and in Greek mythology it is identified with the cup of the god Apollo.

Crux Abbreviation Cru Family Hercules Origin 1603, Uranometria, split from Centaurus Meaning Southern Cross Messiers - Brightest Star Acrux (mag: 0.87) Bordering Constellations Centaurus, Musca Crux is a constellation located in the southern sky in a bright portion of the Milky Way. It is among the most easily distinguished constellations, as none its four main stars has an apparent visual magnitude greater than +2.8, even though it is the smallest of all 88 modern constellations. Its name is Latin for cross, and it is dominated by a cross-shaped or kite-like asterism that is commonly known as the Southern Cross. Predominating the asterism is the most southerly first-magnitude star and brightest star in the constellation, the blue-white Alpha Crucis or Acrux, followed by four other stars, descending in clockwise order by magnitude: Beta, Gamma (one of the closest red giants to Earth), Delta and Epsilon Crucis. Many of these brighter stars are members of the Scorpius\u2013Centaurus Association, a large but loose group of hot blue-white stars that appear to share common origins and motion across the southern Milky Way. The constellation contains four Cepheid variables that are visible to the naked eye under optimum conditions. Crux also contains the bright and colourful open cluster known as the Jewel Box (NGC 4755) and, to the southwest, partly includes the extensive dark nebula, known as the Coalsack Nebula. 31. Cygnus Abbreviation Cyg Family Hercules Origin Ancient Meaning Swan or Northern Cross Messiers M29, M39 Brightest Star Deneb (mag: 1.25) Bordering Constellations Cepheus, Draco, Lyra, Vulpecula, Pegasus, Lacerta Cygnus is a northern constellation lying on the plane of the Milky Way, deriving its name from the Latinized Greek word for swan. The swan is one of the most recognizable constellations of the northern summer and autumn, it features a prominent asterism known as the Northern Cross (in contrast to the Southern Cross). Cygnus was among the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Cygnus contains Deneb, one of the brightest stars in the night sky and one corner of the Summer Triangle, as well as some notable X-ray sources and the giant stellar association of Cygnus OB2. One of the stars of this association, NML Cygni, is one of the largest stars currently known. The constellation is also home to Cygnus X-1, a distant X-ray binary containing a supergiant and unseen massive companion that was the first object widely held to be a black hole. Many star systems in Cygnus have known planets as a result of the Kepler Mission observing one patch of the sky, the patch is the area around Cygnus. In addition, most of the eastern part of Cygnus is dominated by the Hercules\u2013Corona Borealis Great Wall, a giant galaxy filament that is the largest known structure in the observable universe; covering most of the northern sky. 32. Delphinus Abbreviation Del Family Heavenly Waters Origin Ancient Nakshatra Dhanista (\u03b1 to \u03b4 Delphini) Meaning Dolphin Messiers - Brightest Star Rotanev (mag: 3.63) Bordering Constellations Vulpecula, Sagitta, Aquila, Aquarius, Equuleus, Pegasus Delphinus is a constellation in the northern sky, close to the celestial equator. Its name is Latin for dolphin. Delphinus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains among the 88 modern constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union. It is one of the smaller constellations, ranked 69th in size. Delphinus' brightest stars form a distinctive asterism that can easily be recognized. It is bordered (clockwise from north) by Vulpecula the fox, Sagitta the arrow, Aquila the eagle, Aquarius the water-carrier, Equuleus the foal and Pegasus the flying horse. 33. Dorado Abbreviation Dor Family Bayer Origin 1603, Uranometria, created by Keyser and de Houtman Meaning Gold Fish Messiers - Brightest Star \u03b1- Doradus (mag: 3.27) Bordering Constellations Caelum, Horologium, Reticulum, Hydrus, Mensa, Volans, Pictor Dorado is a constellation in the southern sky. It was named in the late 16th century and is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Its name refers to the dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus), which is known as Dorado in Portuguese, although it has also been depicted as a swordfish. Dorado is notable for containing most of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the remainder being in the constellation Mensa. The South ecliptic pole also lies within this constellation. Even though the name Dorado is not Latin but Portuguese, astronomers give it the Latin genitive form Doradus when naming its stars; it is treated (like the adjacent asterism Argo Navis) as a feminine proper name of Greek origin ending in -\u014d (like Io or Callisto or Argo), which have a genitive ending -\u016bs. 34. Draco Abbreviation Dra Family Ursa Major Origin Ancient Meaning Dragon Messiers - Brightest Star Etamin (mag: 2.24) Bordering Constellations Bo\u00f6tes, Hercules, Lyra, Cygnus, Cepheus, Ursa Minor, Camelopardalis, Ursa Major Draco is a constellation in the far northern sky. Its name is Latin for dragon. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. The north pole of the ecliptic is in Draco. Draco is circumpolar (that is, never setting), and can be seen all year from northern latitudes. Thuban (\u03b1 Draconis) was the northern pole star from 3942 BC, when it moved farther north than Theta Bo\u00f6tis, until 1793 BC. The Egyptian Pyramids were designed to have one side facing north, with an entrance passage geometrically aligned so that Thuban would be visible at night. Due to the effects of precession, it will again be the pole star around the year AD 21000. It is a blue-white giant star of magnitude 3.7, 309 light-years from Earth. The traditional name of Alpha Draconis, Thuban, means \"head of the serpent\". 35.

Its name is Latin for lion, and to the ancient Greeks represented the Nemean Lion killed by the mythical Greek hero Heracles (known to the ancient Romans as Hercules) as one of his twelve labors. Its symbol is Leo.svg (Unicode \u264c). One of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, Leo remains one of the 88 modern constellations today, and one of the most easily recognizable due to its many bright stars and a distinctive shape that is reminiscent of the crouching lion it depicts. The lion's mane and shoulders also form an asterism known as \"the Sickle,\" which to modern observers may resemble a backwards \"question mark.\" Leo contains many bright stars, many of which were individually identified by the ancients. There are four stars of first or second magnitude, which render this constellation especially prominent: Algieba, Regulus, Denebola 47. Leo Minor Abbreviation LMi Family Ursa Major Origin Ancient Meaning Lesser Lion Messiers - Brightest Star Praecipua (mag: 3.83) Bordering Constellations Ursa Major, Lynx, Cancer (corner), Leo Leo Minor is a small and faint constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. Its name is Latin for \"the smaller lion\", in contrast to Leo, the larger lion. It lies between the larger and more recognizable Ursa Major to the north and Leo to the south. Leo Minor was not regarded as a separate constellation by classical astronomers; it was designated by Johannes Hevelius in 1687.[2] There are 37 stars brighter than apparent magnitude 6.5 in the constellation; three are brighter than magnitude 4.5. 46 Leonis Minoris, an orange giant of magnitude 3.8, is located some 95 light-years from Earth. At magnitude 4.4, Beta Leonis Minoris is the second brightest star and the only one in the constellation with a Bayer designation. It is a binary star, the brighter component of which is an orange giant and the fainter a yellow-white main sequence star. The third brightest star is 21 Leonis Minoris, a rapidly rotating white main-sequence star of average magnitude 4.5. The constellation also includes two stars with planetary systems, two pairs of interacting galaxies, and the unique deep-sky object Hanny's Voorwerp. 48.

It is one of 48 listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy, and is one of the 88 constellations recognized by the International Astronomical Union. Lyra was often represented on star maps as a vulture or an eagle carrying a lyre, and hence sometimes referred to as Aquila Cadens or Vultur Cadens. Beginning at the north, Lyra is bordered by Draco, Hercules, Vulpecula, and Cygnus. Lyra is visible from the northern hemisphere from spring through autumn, and nearly overhead, in temperate latitudes, during the summer months. From the southern hemisphere, it is visible low in the northern sky during the winter months. Vega, Lyra's brightest star is one of the brightest stars in the night sky, and forms a corner of the famed Summer Triangle asterism. Beta Lyrae is the prototype of a class of stars known as Beta Lyrae variables. These binary stars are so close to each other that they become egg-shaped and material flows from one to the other. Epsilon Lyrae, known informally as the Double Double, is a complex multiple star system. Lyra also hosts the Ring Nebula, the second-discovered and best-known planetary nebula. 53.

One of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, it remains one of the 88 modern constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. It is unique among the modern constellations in being split into two non-contiguous parts, Serpens Caput (Serpent Head) to the west and Serpens Cauda (Serpent Tail) to the east. Between these two halves lies the constellation of Ophiuchus, the \"Serpent-Bearer\". In figurative representations, the body of the serpent is represented as passing behind Ophiuchus between Mu Serpentis in Serpens Caput and Nu Serpentis in Serpens Cauda. The brightest star in Serpens is the red giant star Alpha Serpentis, or Unukalhai, in Serpens Caput, with an apparent magnitude of 2.63. Also located in Serpens Caput are the naked-eye globular cluster Messier 5 and the naked-eye variables R Serpentis and Tau4 Serpentis. Notable extragalactic objects include Seyfert's Sextet, one of the densest galaxy clusters known; Arp 220, the prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy; and Hoag's Object, the most famous of the very rare class of galaxies known as ring galaxies. Part of the Milky Way's galactic plane passes through Serpens Cauda, which is therefore rich in galactic deep-sky objects, such as the Eagle Nebula (IC 4703) and its associated star cluster Messier 16. The nebula measures 70 light-years by 50 light-years and contains the Pillars of Creation, three dust clouds that became famous for the image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. Other striking objects include the Red Square Nebula, one of the few objects in astronomy to take on a square shape; and Westerhout 40, a massive nearby star-forming region consisting of a molecular cloud and an H II region. 76.1 Serpens (Caput) Abbreviation Ser(CP) Family Hercules Origin Ancient Meaning Serpent Head Messiers M5 Brightest Star Unukalhai (mag: 2.63) Bordering Constellations Corona Borealis, Bo\u00f6tes, Virgo, Libra, Ophiuchus, Hercules It represents the Head of the Serpent which is carried by Ophiuchus.

Taurus is a large and prominent constellation in the northern hemisphere's winter sky. It is one of the oldest constellations, dating back to at least the Early Bronze Age when it marked the location of the Sun during the spring equinox. Its importance to the agricultural calendar influenced various bull figures in the mythologies of Ancient Sumer, Akkad, Assyria, Babylon, Egypt, Greece, and Rome. A number of features exist that are of interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest open clusters to Earth, the Pleiades and the Hyades, both of which are visible to the naked eye. At first magnitude, the red giant Aldebaran is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the supernova remnant Messier 1, more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into the northern part of the constellation.

Its name is a Latinized form of the Greek word for telescope. Telescopium was later much reduced in size by Francis Baily and Benjamin Gould. The brightest star in the constellation is Alpha Telescopii, a blue-white subgiant with an apparent magnitude of 3.5, followed by the orange giant star Zeta Telescopii at magnitude 4.1. Eta and PZ Telescopii are two young star systems with debris disks and brown dwarf companions. Telescopium hosts two unusual stars with very little hydrogen that are likely to be the result of two merged white dwarfs: PV Telescopii, also known as HD 168476, is a hot blue extreme helium star, while RS Telescopii is an R Coronae Borealis variable. RR Telescopii is a cataclysmic variable that brightened as a nova to magnitude 6 in 1948. 80. Triangulum Abbreviation Tri Family Perseus Origin Ancient Meaning Triangle Messiers M33 Brightest Star \u03b2-trianguli (mag: 3.00) Bordering Constellations Andromeda, Pisces, Aries, Perseus Triangulum is a small constellation in the northern sky. Its name is Latin for \"triangle\", derived from its three brightest stars, which form a long and narrow triangle. Known to the ancient Babylonians and Greeks, Triangulum was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy. The celestial cartographers Johann Bayer and John Flamsteed catalogued the constellation's stars, giving six of them Bayer designations. The white stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli, of apparent magnitudes 3.00 and 4.00, respectively, form the base of the triangle and the yellow-white Alpha Trianguli, of magnitude 3.41, the apex. Iota Trianguli is a notable double star system, and there are three star systems with planets located in Triangulum. The constellation contains several galaxies, the brightest and nearest of which is the Triangulum Galaxy or Messier 33\u2014a member of the Local Group. The first quasar ever observed, 3C 48, also lies within Triangulum's boundaries. 81. Triangulum Australe Abbreviation TrA Family Hercules Origin Ancient Meaning Southern Triangle Messiers - Brightest Star Atria (mag: 1.91) Bordering Constellations Ara, Circinus, Apus Triangulum Australe is a small constellation in the far Southern Celestial Hemisphere. Its name is Latin for \"the southern triangle\", which distinguishes it from Triangulum in the northern sky and is derived from the almost equilateral pattern of its three brightest stars. It was first depicted on a celestial globe as Triangulus Antarcticus by Petrus Plancius in 1589, and later with more accuracy and its current name by Johann Bayer in his 1603 Uranometria. The French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille charted and gave the brighter stars their Bayer designations in 1756. Alpha Trianguli Australis, known as Atria, is a second magnitude orange giant and the brightest star in the constellation, as well as the 42nd-brightest star in the night sky. Completing the triangle are the two white main sequence stars Beta and Gamma Trianguli Australis. Although the constellation lies in the Milky Way and contains many stars, deep-sky objects are not prominent. Notable features include the open cluster NGC 6025 and planetary nebula NGC 5979. 82. Tucana Abbreviation Tuc Family Bayer Origin 1603, Uranometria, created by Keyser and de Houtman Meaning Toucan Messiers - Brightest Star \u03b1-Tucanae (mag: 2.87) Bordering Constellations Grus, Indus, Octans, Hydrus, Eridanus (corner), Phoenix Tucana is a constellation of stars in the southern sky, named after the toucan, a South American bird. It is one of twelve constellations conceived in the late sixteenth century by Petrus Plancius from the observations of Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. Tucana first appeared on a 35-centimetre-diameter (14 in) celestial globe published in 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius and Jodocus Hondius and was depicted in Johann Bayer's star atlas Uranometria of 1603. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille gave its stars Bayer designations in 1756. The constellations Tucana, Grus, Phoenix and Pavo are collectively known as the \"Southern Birds\". Tucana is not a prominent constellation as all of its stars are third magnitude or fainter; the brightest is Alpha Tucanae with an apparent visual magnitude of 2.87. Beta Tucanae is a star system with six member stars, while Kappa is a quadruple system. Five star systems have been found to have exoplanets to date. The constellation contains 47 Tucanae, one of the brightest globular clusters in the sky, and most of the Small Magellanic Cloud. 83. Ursa Major Abbreviation UMa Family Ursa Major Origin Ancient Meaning Great Bear Messiers M40, M81, M82, M97, M101, M108, M109 Brightest Star Alioth (mag: 1.76) Bordering Constellations Draco, Camelopardalis, Lynx, Leo Minor, Leo, Coma Berenices, Canes Venatici, Bo\u00f6tes Ursa Major (also known as the Great Bear) is a constellation in the northern celestial hemisphere. One of the 48 constellations listed by Ptolemy (second century AD), it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. It can be visible throughout the year in most of the northern hemisphere. Its name, Latin for \"the greater (or larger) she-bear\", stands as a reference to and in direct contrast with Ursa Minor, \"the smaller she-bear\", with which it is frequently associated in mythology and amateur astronomy. The constellation's most recognizable asterism, a group of seven relatively bright stars commonly known as the \"Big Dipper\", \"the Wagon\" or \"the Plough\" (among others), both mimics the shape of the lesser bear (the \"Little Dipper\") and is commonly used as a navigational pointer towards the current northern pole star, Polaris in Ursa Minor. The Big Dipper and the constellation as a whole have mythological significance in numerous world cultures, usually as a symbol of the north. The third largest constellation in the sky, Ursa Major is home to many deep-sky objects including seven Messier objects, four other NGC objects and I Zwicky 18, the youngest known galaxy in the visible universe. 84. Ursa Minor Abbreviation UMi Family Ursa Major Origin Ancient Meaning Lesser Bear Messiers - Brightest Star Polaris (mag: 1.97) Bordering Constellations Draco, Camelopardalis, Cepheus Ursa Mino, also known as the Little Bear, is a constellation in the Northern Sky. Like the Great Bear, the tail of the Little Bear may also be seen as the handle of a ladle, hence the North American name, Little Dipper: seven stars with four in its bowl like its partner the Big Dipper. It was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor has traditionally been important for navigation, particularly by mariners, because of Polaris being the North Star. Polaris, the brightest star in the constellation, is a yellow-white supergiant and the brightest Cepheid variable star in the night sky, ranging from an apparent magnitude of 1.97 to 2.00. Beta Ursae Minoris, also known as Kochab, is an aging star that has swollen and cooled to become an orange giant with an apparent magnitude of 2.08, only slightly fainter than Polaris. Kochab and magnitude 3 Gamma Ursae Minoris have been called the \"guardians of the pole star\". Planets have been detected orbiting four of the stars, including Kochab. The constellation also contains an isolated neutron star\u2014Calvera\u2014and H1504+65, the hottest white dwarf yet discovered, with a surface temperature of 200,000 K. 85. Vela Abbreviation Vel Family Heavenly Waters Origin 1763, Lacaille split from Argo Navis Meaning Sails Messiers - Brightest Star Regor (mag: 1.75) Bordering Constellations Antlia, Pyxis, Puppis, Carina, Centaurus Vela is a constellation in the southern sky. Its name is Latin for the sails of a ship, and it was originally part of a larger constellation, the ship Argo Navis, which was later divided into three parts, the others being Carina and Puppis. With an apparent magnitude of 1.8, its brightest star is the hot blue multiple star Gamma Velorum, one component of which is the brightest Wolf-Rayet star in the sky. Delta and Kappa Velorum, together with Epsilon and Iota Carinae, form the asterism known as the False Cross. 1.95-magnitude Delta is actually a triple or quintuple star system. 86. Virgo Abbreviation Vir Family Zodiac Origin Ancient Meaning Virgin/Maiden Nakshatra Chitra (Spica) Messiers M49, M58, M59, M60, M61, M84, M86, M87, M89, M90, M104 Brightest Star Spica (mag: 0.98) Bordering Constellations Bo\u00f6tes, Coma Berenices, Leo, Crater, Corvus, Hydra, Libra, Serpens Caput Virgo is one of the constellations of the zodiac. Its name is Latin for virgin, and its symbol is \u264d. Lying between Leo to the west and Libra to the east, it is the second largest constellation in the sky (after Hydra). It can be easily found through its brightest star, Spica. The bright Spica makes it easy to locate Virgo, as it can be found by following the curve of the Big Dipper/Plough to Arcturus in Bo\u00f6tes and continuing from there in the same curve. Because of the presence of a galaxy cluster (consequently called the Virgo cluster) within its borders 5\u00b0 to 12\u00b0 west of \u03b5 Vir (Vindemiatrix), this constellation is especially rich in galaxies. 87.

On changing C we get different Lagrangian Points LAGRANGIAN POINTS Wikipedia Article In celestial mechanics, the Lagrangian points; also Lagrange points, L-points, or libration points) are positions in an orbital configuration of two large bodies where a small object affected only by gravity can maintain a stable position relative to the two large bodies. The Lagrange points mark positions where the combined gravitational pull of the two large masses provides precisely the centripetal force required to orbit with them. There are five such points, labeled L1 to L5, all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies. The first three are on the line connecting the two large bodies and the last two, L4 and L5, each form an equilateral triangle with the two large bodies. The two latter points are stable, which implies that objects can orbit around them in a rotating coordinate system tied to the two large bodies.L1, L2, L3 are unstable We have considered $$m_2 \\ll m_1$$","title":"Celestial Mechanics"},{"location":"space/#celestial-mechanics","text":"","title":"CELESTIAL MECHANICS"},{"location":"space/#2-body-problem","text":"","title":"2 - Body Problem"},{"location":"space/#introduction-and-calculations","text":"If vectors are written without vector notation it represents the magnitude of the vector.

The Lagrange points mark positions where the combined gravitational pull of the two large masses provides precisely the centripetal force required to orbit with them. There are five such points, labeled L1 to L5, all in the orbital plane of the two large bodies. The first three are on the line connecting the two large bodies and the last two, L4 and L5, each form an equilateral triangle with the two large bodies. The two latter points are stable, which implies that objects can orbit around them in a rotating coordinate system tied to the two large bodies.L1, L2, L3 are unstable We have considered $$m_2 \\ll m_1$$","title":"LAGRANGIAN POINTS"}]}
